WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wireguard.com\u002Fimg\u002Fwireguard.svg","PUID","100","PGID","TZ","Europe\u002FLondon","Specify a timezone to use EG Europe\u002FLondon","SERVERURL","wireguard.domain.com","External IP or domain name for docker host.

Kernels newer than 5.6 generally have the wireguard module built-in (along with some older custom kernels). However, the module may not be enabled. Make sure it is enabled prior to starting the container.\n\nIf the kernel is not built-in, or installed on host, the container will check if the kernel headers are present (in `\u002Fusr\u002Fsrc`) and if not, it will attempt to download the necessary kernel headers from the `ubuntu xenial\u002Fbionic`, `debian\u002Fraspbian buster` repos; then will attempt to compile and install the kernel module. If the kernel headers are not found in either `usr\u002Fsrc` or in the repos mentioned, container will sleep indefinitely as wireguard cannot be installed.\n\nIf you're on a debian\u002Fubuntu based host with a custom or downstream distro provided kernel (ie. Pop!_OS), the container won't be able to install the kernel headers from the regular ubuntu and debian repos. In those cases, you can try installing the headers on the host via `sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)` (if distro version) and then add a volume mapping for `\u002Fusr\u002Fsrc:\u002Fusr\u002Fsrc`, or if custom built, map the location of the existing headers to allow the container to use host installed headers to build the kernel module (tested successful on Pop!_OS, ymmv).\n\nWith regards to arm32\u002F64 devices, Raspberry Pi 2-4 running the [official ubuntu images](https:\u002F\u002Fubuntu.com\u002Fdownload\u002Fraspberry-pi) or Raspbian Buster are supported out of the box. For all other devices and OSes, you can try installing the kernel headers on the host, and mapping `\u002Fusr\u002Fsrc:\u002Fusr\u002Fsrc` and it may just work (no guarantees).\n\nThis can be run as a server or a client, based on the parameters used.\n\n## Server Mode\n\nIf the environment variable `PEERS` is set to a number or a list of strings separated by comma, the container will run in server mode and the necessary server and peer\u002Fclient confs will be generated. The peer\u002Fclient config qr codes will be output in the docker log if `LOG_CONFS` is set to `true`. They will also be saved in text and png format under `\u002Fconfig\u002FpeerX` in case `PEERS` is a variable and an integer or `\u002Fconfig\u002Fpeer_X` in case a list of names was provided instead of an integer.\n\nVariables `SERVERURL`, `SERVERPORT`, `INTERNAL_SUBNET`, `PEERDNS`, `INTERFACE`, `ALLOWEDIPS` and `PERSISTENTKEEPALIVE_PEERS` are optional variables used for server mode. Any changes to these environment variables will trigger regeneration of server and peer confs. Peer\u002Fclient confs will be recreated with existing private\u002Fpublic keys. Delete the peer folders for the keys to be recreated along with the confs.\n\nTo add more peers\u002Fclients later on, you increment the `PEERS` environment variable or add more elements to the list and recreate the container.\n\nTo display the QR codes of active peers again, you can use the following command and list the peer numbers as arguments: `docker exec -it wireguard \u002Fapp\u002Fshow-peer 1 4 5` or `docker exec -it wireguard \u002Fapp\u002Fshow-peer myPC myPhone myTablet` (Keep in mind that the QR codes are also stored as PNGs in the config folder).\n\nThe templates used for server and peer confs are saved under `\u002Fconfig\u002Ftemplates`. Advanced users can modify these templates and force conf generation by deleting `\u002Fconfig\u002Fwg0.conf` and restarting the container.\n\n## Client Mode\n\nDo not set the `PEERS` environment variable. Drop your client conf into the config folder as `\u002Fconfig\u002Fwg0.conf` and start the container.\n\nIf you get IPv6 related errors in the log and connection cannot be established, edit the `AllowedIPs` line in your peer\u002Fclient wg0.conf to include only `0.0.0.0\u002F0` and not `::\u002F0`; and restart the container.\n\n## Road warriors, roaming and returning home\n\nIf you plan to use Wireguard both remotely and locally, say on your mobile phone, you will need to consider routing. Most firewalls will not route ports forwarded on your WAN interface correctly to the LAN out of the box. This means that when you return home, even though you can see the Wireguard server, the return packets will probably get lost.\n\nThis is not a Wireguard specific issue and the two generally accepted solutions are NAT reflection (setting your edge router\u002Ffirewall up in such a way as it translates internal packets correctly) or split horizon DNS (setting your internal DNS to return the private rather than public IP when connecting locally).\n\nBoth of these approaches have positives and negatives however their setup is out of scope for this document as everyone's network layout and equipment will be different.\n\n## Maintaining local access to attached services\n\n** Note: This is not a supported configuration by Linuxserver.io - use at your own risk.\n\nWhen routing via Wireguard from another container using the `service` option in docker, you might lose access to the containers webUI locally. To avoid this, exclude the docker subnet from being routed via Wireguard by modifying your `wg0.conf` like so (modifying the subnets as you require):\n\n  ```ini\n  [Interface]\n  PrivateKey = \u003Cprivate key\u003E\n  Address = 9.8.7.6\u002F32\n  DNS = 8.8.8.8\n  PostUp = DROUTE=$(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}'); HOMENET=192.168.0.0\u002F16; HOMENET2=10.0.0.0\u002F8; HOMENET3=172.16.0.0\u002F12; ip route add $HOMENET3 via $DROUTE;ip route add $HOMENET2 via $DROUTE; ip route add $HOMENET via $DROUTE;iptables -I OUTPUT -d $HOMENET -j ACCEPT;iptables -A OUTPUT -d $HOMENET2 -j ACCEPT; iptables -A OUTPUT -d $HOMENET3 -j ACCEPT;  iptables -A OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT\n  PreDown = HOMENET=192.168.0.0\u002F16; HOMENET2=10.0.0.0\u002F8; HOMENET3=172.16.0.0\u002F12; ip route del $HOMENET3 via $DROUTE;ip route del $HOMENET2 via $DROUTE; ip route del $HOMENET via $DROUTE; iptables -D OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT; iptables -D OUTPUT -d $HOMENET -j ACCEPT; iptables -D OUTPUT -d $HOMENET2 -j ACCEPT; iptables -D OUTPUT -d $HOMENET3 -j ACCEPT\n  ```\n\n## Site-to-site VPN\n\n** Note: This is not a supported configuration by Linuxserver.io - use at your own risk.\n\nSite-to-site VPN in server mode requires customizing the `AllowedIPs` statement for a specific peer in `wg0.conf`. Since `wg0.conf` is autogenerated when server vars are changed, it is not recommended to edit it manually.\n\nIn order to customize the `AllowedIPs` statement for a specific peer in `wg0.conf`, you can set an env var `SERVER_ALLOWEDIPS_PEER_\u003Cpeer name or number\u003E` to the additional subnets you'd like to add, comma separated and excluding the peer IP (ie. `\"192.168.1.0\u002F24,192.168.2.0\u002F24\"`). Replace `\u003Cpeer name or number\u003E` with either the name or number of a peer (whichever is used in the `PEERS` var).\n\nFor instance `SERVER_ALLOWEDIPS_PEER_laptop=\"192.168.1.0\u002F24,192.168.2.0\u002F24\"` will result in the wg0.conf entry `AllowedIPs = 10.13.13.2,192.168.1.0\u002F24,192.168.2.0\u002F24` for the peer named `laptop`.\n\nKeep in mind that this var will only be considered when the confs are regenerated. Adding this var for an existing peer won't force a regeneration. You can delete wg0.conf and restart the container to force regeneration if necessary.\n\nDon't forget to set the necessary POSTUP and POSTDOWN rules in your client's peer conf for lan access.\n","json"))
