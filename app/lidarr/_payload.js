To support hardlinking, simply ensure that the Music and downloads data are on a single volume. For example, if you have \u002Fmnt\u002Fstorage\u002FMusic and \u002Fmnt\u002Fstorage\u002Fdownloads\u002Fcompleted\u002FMusic, you would want something like \u002Fmnt\u002Fstorage:\u002Fmedia for your volume. Then you can hardlink from \u002Fmedia\u002Fdownloads\u002Fcompleted to \u002Fmedia\u002FMusic.\n\nAnother item to keep in mind, is that within lidarr itself, you should then map your download client folder to your lidarr folder: Settings -\u003E Download Client -\u003E advanced -\u003E remote path mappings. I input the host of my download client (matches the download client defined) remote path is \u002Fdownloads\u002FMusic (relative to the internal container path) and local path is \u002Fmedia\u002Fdownloads\u002Fcompleted\u002FMusic, assuming you have folders to seperate your downloaded data types.\n\n### Media folders\n\nWe have set `\u002Fmusic` and `\u002Fdownloads` as ***optional paths***, this is because it is the easiest way to get started. While easy to use, it has some drawbacks. Mainly losing the ability to hardlink (TL;DR a way for a file to exist in multiple places on the same file system while only consuming one file worth of space), or atomic move (TL;DR instant file moves, rather than copy+delete) files while processing content.\n\nUse the optional paths if you dont understand, or dont want hardlinks\u002Fatomic moves.\n\nThe folks over at servarr.com wrote a good [write-up](https:\u002F\u002Fwiki.servarr.com\u002Fdocker-guide#consistent-and-well-planned-paths) on how to get started with this.\n","06.05.22:","json"))
